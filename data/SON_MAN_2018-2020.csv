Why are Christians so bad at just saying, “Wow, death is awful” ?

My mother in law has told me some of the awful things ppl said to her when her 19 year old son died. 

Y’all, if Jesus WEPT you can too. That’s it. Just weep with those who weep. 

No sermonizing needed.

JESUS was made Unrecognizable !

So You could be Recognizable again

The Word of GOD in Isaiah 52 says,

His appearance
Was so disfigured
That He did not look like a man,
&
His form
Did not resemble a human being -

Jesus restores identity, image, ect.

“Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to Spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again.’” (John 3:7).
   
  Jesus, speaking to the Jewish teacher, confirms that the new birth is an Old Testament teaching. The new birth precedes faith.

To fail is human. 

That’s why our hope should be in the perfect work of Jesus Christ. He did what we cannot do on our behalf. 

Forgive your failures.
