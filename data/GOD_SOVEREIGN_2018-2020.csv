This morning's meditation:

God loves everyone, ""good enough"" or not, and that is a grace.

And.

Jesus specifically sought out those who were not ""good enough"" - who weren't qualified, asked questions, made others uncomfortable.

And that, today, is a grace for me.

LOVE tells people the truth about sin and how it separates man from God. 
It’s not popular, 
the world might turn against you, 
they killed the prophets, 
Jesus gave His life for it.

If the world hates you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.

God works His Will most often through people, but people (even believers) aren’t always “Willing” and that’s why Jesus asks us to pray for His Will to be done on earth as in heaven; This means through us not to us.  Revival starts in your shoes. Be ready and Willing, you are able

 Many took Jesus for the Son of God, and even God himself. Some thought that Jesus’s mother also deserves worship. But the Qur’an restores the teachings of Jesus, who said: """"Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship him. This is a straight path"""" (Qur’an 3:51).

Getting into heaven isn't a scale, where your good deeds outweigh your bad.  One bad deed or thought disqualifies you (Romans 3:10,3:23).  You cannot earn your way.  Jesus paid the price though.  Trust in Jesus as your Savior and God applies Jesus's perfect righteousness to you.

With all that's going on in the world, I was reminded that prayer changes things. Jesus was asked why he did not go into the house of the leaders and change laws and he told them he came to fulfill the will of God. I will March, but Prayer and the word of God is the true weapon.

Since Jesus, who was once an Immigrant child fleeing persecution, was used by God to save the lost/make disciples, then surely God is using some Christian Undocumented Immigrants/Migrants fleeing persecution, to come to the US to share Gospel/disciple some American Christians.

God often sends extraordinary things in ordinary packages.
1) Jesus Christ: flesh and blood but “the Word was made flesh"" 2) Your Bible: paper bound in leather but “ All Scripture is given by inspiration of God” 3) We're all flawed but “we have this treasure in earthen vessels”

30. But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
31. That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.

But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

I really want God’s best. Life is crazy, and my decision making skills are pretty erroneous at times. Bad combo. 

Take me to the water, Jesus.

Jesus prioritized divine healing during His earthly ministry. Jesus, who is “the same yesterday, today & forever” (Heb 13:8) will do the same for u today. He will never miss an opportunity to do good to u, to heal u of ur broken body, emotional scars & weary spirit & to bless u!

Engaged some students this week regarding their views on religion. And most of the reasons for their unbelief in (the existence) Jesus is affected by the way the church behave. Do not discredit the existence of my Lord just because I can’t perfectly express His Love to the world.
