Note to self: Jesus didn’t die on that cross for you to pick your body apart, compare to others on social media, or feel anxious/depressed. He came that we may have peace beyond understanding. and there’s no depth or distance He won’t go to rescue you from the ways of this world.

It pays to serve Jesus, I speak from my heart;
He’ll always be with us, if we do our part;
There’s naught in this wide world can pleasure afford,
There’s peace and contentment in serving the Lord.

See that you not be deceived, for many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and ‘The time has come.’ Do not follow them!” Lk 21:8 Keep your eyes on Jesus alone - He will lead you to all truth and love. Peace

Jesus says, “Come to me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest for your souls.”  —Matthew 11:28
Notice Jesus doesn’t say, “Come to me strong, cheerful, calm , untroubled or sinless ”.

Jesus is too real 
 how can anyone doubt his existence? Like I literally be feeling his presence and peace. Sometimes it feels like I’m being hugged by a really warm person; that’s how I know Jesus is around me

""...the fruit of the Spirit IS love..."" peace, patience, and kindness are like colour, flavour, and nutrients of one fruit. And like a fruit it grows over time, not overnight. Jesus said, ""whoever remains in me he shall bear much fruit."" Stay in the vine of Jesus & grow in love.

A lot of times we just gloss over scripture not realizing it’s significance. God promised to make a covenant of peace with His chosen people. A covenant is a promise, guarantee, commitment, contract, bond, indenture. Hello-Peace is guaranteed through Christ Jesus! It’s 100%!

Peace is the one thing the enemy cannot counterfeit.
He has a counterfeit for happiness. 
He has a counterfeit for love.
Peace can only come from Jesus! 
That's the good news of Christmas!
