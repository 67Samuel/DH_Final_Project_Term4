The Qur’an (3:92) says to give freely without expecting any returns.

Jesus (Matthew 25:35) says “I was a stranger & you invited me in.”

Exodus (23:9) says do not oppress foreigners. Leviticus (19:34) says to love strangers.

What are the common threads?

When we hold onto anger, bitterness, and unforgiveness, we do the devil’s work for him.
 
But when we let God help us trade anger for kindness, resentment for compassion and bitterness for gentleness... it splits this cold world wide open with the warmth of Jesus.

Jesus says to simply “Just Come” 

It doesn’t matter whether you’ve had an abortion

Or have been divorced 

Or done drugs

He wants to change you, from the inside out. He wants to show you what TRUE love and mercy feels like. 

Turn to Him and let Him wash your failures away
