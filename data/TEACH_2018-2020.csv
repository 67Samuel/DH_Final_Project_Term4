Our faith transcends logic and it will always look stupid to unbelievers. 

Just continue to preach the gospel and every other thing will follow once Jesus becomes their standard

Two ways false teaching gains traction in church:

1) thru evangelistic impulse: ""If we put it this way, non-Ctians will listen.""

2) thru friendship: ""His teaching is a little off, but he's a good guy. I know him. He loves Jesus.""

God uses bad for good; Satan uses good for bad.

You think it’s best to bring others to Jesus by only talking about the goodness of God, but in reality, without the preaching of Hell, & the realization of one’s own sins & the need for repentance—you will never know the true goodness & love of God in saving undeserving sinners.

I've been following Jesus for a lot of years, but today Pastor Michelle Dodson preached a sermon from John 11 - ""Who are you waiting for?"" - that introduced me to the Savior all over again. 

The power of good preaching will never cease to amaze me.

Jesus trusted John as family.. family is not always blood.

When Jesus saw His mother & John whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.” Then He said to John, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.…

The disciples didn’t know how the story of Jesus ends when he was on the cross – that he would redeem all with greatest good news ever. Story of Jesus is the ultimate resource that resolves all issues of trauma with a promise that never fails, if one will receive it; its not easy

When you’re in a battle and you feel like God has given up on you just remember, in Mark 6 when Jesus was praying on the mountain and the disciples were in the storm at the lake, Jesus could see them from the mountain. Sometimes you go through the storm so God can watch you grow.

Grace MUST be balanced by truth.

Truth MUST have grace to be balanced.

There is NO choice! Grace AND Truth came by the Lord Jesus Christ.

“Choosing” one over the other leaves one without the real Jesus! This results in one preaching a false gospel!

The BEST way to ensure that we Believers in GOD & Disciples of Jesus are able to effectively answer The LORD's call to be out ""IN THE WORLD"" witnessing to those not yet in a relationship w/ GOD;  yet ""NOT OF IT"" -  is to pray & read The Bible before logging on & stepping out! :-)

A voice preaching
Should never be comprised of
Alluring words in man's wisdom

This way
Your faith
Is not found in man's wisdom

Instead
It should be comprised of
Christ Jesus & The Holy Spirit
Substantiated through
The Power of God !
