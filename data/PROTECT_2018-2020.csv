God, 

Your peace which surpasses all understanding, will guard my heart & mind through Jesus. May I protect my peace with the very things I allow myself to see, hear, & do. I want nothing but to please you & not let my own selfish desires get in the way of drawing close to you.

My #prayer today: Lord #Jesus you are my strength. My help. My hope. My defender. My strong tower. My shield. My deliverer. My vindicator. The lover of my soul. My conqueror. My fortress. My hiding place. My closest friend. My life’s companion. In you I trust all things.

I saw a sign that read “Jesus dies for our sins”. I thought about it for a while: Did Jesus die for our sins or was he killed by the capitalist state of the Roman Empire to protect the status quo from Jesus teachings of moral equality and equity?

There are no indispensable preachers or teachers.

Jesus--no one else--is the cornerstone.

He owns the church.

He bought it.

He won't desert it.

Even if we fail to protect the church, Jesus will build it.

Set your watch by that.

Being falsely accused for something is always frustrating, but remember Jesus, Job, and Moses were all accused wrongly. Sometimes it happens from someone wrongly presuming something and other times it’s out of jealousy and hatred. Stay calm,defend your case by speaking the truth!

Okay. I need to say this. WE ARE ONE CHURCH BODY. When Jesus called us to be His, we were called into brideship. Now, what that means, WE WORK TOGETHER AND LOVE EACH OTHER. Yes, judge by fruit. Yes, don’t fall into false theology. Yes, guard your heart. All of the above are good
