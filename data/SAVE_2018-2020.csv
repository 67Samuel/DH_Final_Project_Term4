Religious Muslims are considered saved in Judaism, we fall under the category of B'nai Noach as Islām already includes the 7 Noachide laws.

We're also considered saved in Christanity as Jesus promised the thief on the cross heaven for only saying he was innocent (Luke 23:41).

And all the world go free?
No, there’s a cross for everyone,
And there’s a cross for me.

For we believe with confidence that the son of man came to seek and save those who were lost, we believe Jesus Christ will respond  and with that in mind, let's pray, ""Dear Jesus,take control, fix me,empower me,help me do what God is leading me to do please?"

Whom the Son sets free is free indeed! Do you want to be free? Ask Jesus to set you free and believe He has done it in Jesus name amen!
