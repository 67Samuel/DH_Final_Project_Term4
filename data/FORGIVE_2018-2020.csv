If you’re ONLY talking about Jesus’s love, grace, & forgiveness, you’re talking about a false gospel. And preaching a false gospel is false teaching. Yes, He’s loving, but He’s also just & coming to judge. Jesus preached on repenting because the kingdom of heaven is near. Are we?

If you use the Bible to justify your hatred against someone, then you’ve completely missed the point. 
If you’re only loving people that are similar to you, then you’ve completely missed the point. 

Jesus literally forgave people as they were nailing Him to a cross. Jesus LOVED.

Dear Lord, tonight I am confessing my sins and asking for forgiveness. I have recently lied, used foul language, let my anger get the best of me and worst of all made choices specifically for me and not for you. I am so very sorry for these sins. In Jesus’ name, Amen.

Christians need to learn what Jesus meant when He said “forgive them Father, for they know not what they do”.

If you’re going to get offended every time someone bad mouths God then you’ll become an individual that reacts in offence instead responding in love.

Jesus is the Son of God. He died for your sins on the cross, was buried, and was raised from the dead. If we put our faith and trust in Him He will forgive our sins, change our life, and we can have eternal life with Him forever in heaven.

We cheapen what Jesus Christ did on the cross when we imply that it's only about forgiveness and the grace of God. But the cross also shows how much God hates evil and how much he is angry at sin because sin damages the people he created!

We shouldnt be using the fact that Jesus associated with sinners as an excuse to sin. Jesus came to save sinners. He ate with cheating tax-collectors & prostitutes not as a sign of condoning what they did but as a sign that He wanted to forgive them. He told them to “sin no more

Like Christ, we bear the weight of unjust accusations & underserved pain, & we don't retaliate when harmed.

1 John 3 contrasts the way of Cain with with the way of Christ.

Cain took another’s life.
Jesus laid down his life for others.

Blood marked Cain’s guilt.
Blood marks Jesus followers as forgiven.

Cain was driven by envious hate.
Jesus came in selfless love.

How’s about some unadulterated gospel now?

All your sin..every last bit of it..past, present, and future..is forgiven. For Jesus’ sake. 
You’re free in Christ!

SHE REALIZED SHE WAS FORGIVEN, NOT BECAUSE SHES WORTHY BUT BECAUSE JESUS IS. SHE IS LOVED, NOT BECAUSE SHE IS LOVABLE, BUT BECAUSE HE IS A LOVING GOD, SHE IS A CHILD OF GOD, NOT BECAUSE SHE IS GOOD ENOUGH, BUT BECAUSE HE CREATED HER TO BE.

This is the Gospel of Grace: God, who out of love for us, sent the only Son He ever had, wrapped in skin. Jesus learned how to walk, cried for His milk, sweat blood in the night, was lashed & beat & showered in spit, was fixed to a cross, & died whispering forgiveness on us all.

Proverbs 20: 7
The righteous lead blameless lives;
    blessed are their children after them.
#ThisIsElijahTheProphet
Are blameless before the Lord. This is the time to repent for the forgiveness of sin and behold You will be cleansed in the blood of Jesus.

The thing that drew me to faith in Jesus was not the promise of a better life but a conviction of my own sin and the need for forgiveness.

What I received from Him was not just forgiveness, but overwhelming love.

Thinking about that today.

Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
JESUS is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling
O come to the altar...
Forgiveness was bought with The precious Blood of Jesus Christ...

If you are lost, be still and know that God has sent Jesus to find you, save you, redeem you, forgive you, and HE EVEN DIED JUST FOR YOU.

That's a real gift and something to be THANKFUL for.

I pray that you accept all God has given just for you, now. Amen.

Jesus was a rebel.

He preached love amidst hate.
He forgave the unforgivable.
He unleashed fury to those besmirching the Temple with worldly desires.
He caressed the lepers. 
He championed the poor.

To be a Christian is to be Christ-like. A rebellious force of goodness.

If unauthorized leader, James Dobson can baptize unfaithful Donald Trump, then certainly authorized Jesus can baptize faithful lgbtq people.

""Forgiving"" lies at the heart of the Gospel.  It should be a litmus test separating those who are committed to Christ from those who are not.  When you forgive, you follow the example of Jesus.  When you harbor bitterness and resentment, you follow the example of Satan.""
