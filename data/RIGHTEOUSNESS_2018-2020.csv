In prayer, don't always talk to GOD and say amen and leave, don't just shout from the outercourts, go further, to the Holy place, where it's nolonger about you but only Jesus and what He wants.Then, by grace go to the Holy of holies where you will tremble at His tangible glory.

To speak & anoint a few

Now He chooses
To live in you

When we receive Jesus
The Holy Spirit does a work

Thou didst leave Thy throne and 
Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest 
to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home
was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity.
O come to my heart, 
Lord Jesus,
There is room in my heart for Thee.

~Hymn lyrics by E.S. Elliot

No one other than God could redeem us
#Jesus is God 
A created being couldn't pay the infinite penalty for sin against an infinite God

No one but God can intercede for us
#Jesus #HolySpirit

God is not a committee of saints
God is the #Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit. Period.

Jesus willingly gave his life & died under Judgement in the Law place of sinners, so that they may be forgiven & reconciled to God. 

He lived a perfectly righteous life & gives that righteousness to others as a gift thru faith.

Raised again, he is the reconciler of ALL THINGS.

There’s this one of the most awaited day of every year — Jesus Reigns! A day of celebration for seeking to honor God & worship Jesus Christ, that comes and flows with love along with praising His glory of great righteousness around our nation. Thank you always, Papa Jesus!

Jesus does not possess tiny hints--itty-bitty specks--of the warrior.

Jesus was and is the PERFECT FULFILLMENT of the Old Testament warriors.

The line of holy warrior-kings did not die with David or his sons.

The Son of God crushed the head of Satan.

He rescued us.

A pure heart for the gospel will always rejoice, cheer on, and celebrate anyone doing real gospel ministry! Small hearts are cynical, critical, and competitive. Large hearts love big and rejoice in what Jesus is doing anywhere He's doing it. Let Jesus grow your heart large!

The most encouraging thing you can do for your pastor is to love Jesus and re-order your life around Him. Nothing energizes us as much as witnessing the fruit of righteousness and mission produced from the lives of those we shepherd.
