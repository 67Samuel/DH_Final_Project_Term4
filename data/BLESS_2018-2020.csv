"". . . What then?
Are we to sin because
we are not under law
but under grace?
By no means!

. . . For the wages of sin
is death, but the free gift
of God is eternal life in
Christ Jesus our Lord.""

Romans 6:23, ESV

3/7 Scripture is clear, Jesus intended His sound teachings to be a blessing to people for a more abundant and joyful life, not a long list to be checked to prove conversion.

Why do we give gifts at Christmas?

Because we’ve always done it at Christmas?
Or..that is represents the gift that God has given us in His Son Christ Jesus.
And the gift of forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation..in Christ Jesus.
Both may be true..but I prefer the 2nd reason.

It's so sweet to trust in Jesus, just to take him at his words. Just to lean upon his promise. Just to know thus says the Lord. Jesus !Jesus! how I trust him, how I've proved him over and over. Jesus !Jesus! blessed Jesus! oh for grace to trust you more.

Invite others to come unto Christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
