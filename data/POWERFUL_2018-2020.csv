When God chose Mary to be the mother of Jesus it was because he was pleased with her life. 
—When God chooses someone for a special purpose, He looks at the person’s heart. God didn’t choose someone who was rich or popular or powerful; He chose someone who was humble.

In Luke 4:1-14, Jesus manifested three dimensions of Power.
1. Jesus was filled with the Spirit.
2. Jesus was led by the Spirit.
3. Jesus returned in Power.

The central problem of our age is not liberalism..or the threat of communism or rationalism. All these are dangerous but not the primary threat. The real problem is this: the church of Jesus Christ doing the Lord’s work in the power of the flesh rather than the Spirit.

Forgiveness is the most powerful thing. We live in an age though where it’s looked upon as a weakness. Someone says or doe something wrong. They admit guilt, say they’re wrong. Why not forgive and heal? Jesus said it best to the Pharisees: “He withOUT sin, throw the first stone.”

Christians, if you have power, use it to protect those who don’t. If you have resources, use them to provide for those who don’t. If you have a voice, use it to speak for those who don’t. Jesus did all of this and more for you.

Jesus Aguilar is getting a lot of attention for hitting homers, but it's his approach that is so amazing. He hits for contact + power to all areas of the field. Maybe the best two strike approach in the bigs. He's not just a power hitter. He's a hitter (and an All Star) #Brewers

In politics, might makes right and the ends justify the means. It’s about power and getting your way. Truth and virtue are tools to win arguments and gain power. But, in Christianity, Jesus IS the Way. He is the End. The means must align with who He is or the victory is empty.

It's interesting that evangelicals claim they are vocal about ""everything"" (it's their schtick) but hush hush about their very strong core beliefs that would harm people's perceptions of them.

Like how they believe Jewish people murdered Jesus. Or trying to force the apocalypse.
