Being relaxed feels wonderful. Being nervous, tense, and worried are not so wonderful. Why aren't more people relaxed? Jesus said if we are weary and overburdened, we should go to Him and He will give us rest, relaxation, and ease (see Matt. 11:28 –29.) #JoyceQuote #RestInGod

Isn’t it worth noting that Jesus stood to watch the widow give her mite 

Next time you want to sing “Wetin I go give to you”, remember that you can give God your life and give him your money too..

Here we see into the deepest, remotest regions of His core being — who He truly is way down deep. 

We have been abused and betrayed many times. Jesus doesn’t do that. He never does that.

Jesus says, “Come to me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest for your souls.”  —Matthew 11:28
Notice Jesus doesn’t say, “Come to me strong, cheerful, calm , untroubled or sinless ”.

There is something in the name Jesus that will cause people to look at you when you say it.  It truly is the name above all names.  Those who are His will smile and those who are not will give you ""the look"", indicating their displeasure with your word choice.
