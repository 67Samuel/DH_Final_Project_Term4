The ""falling away"" in scripture regarding the last days are those who were very religious, but never had a relationship with Jesus by being born again.
Those will fall away because they never received Jesus in their hearts, but just had a lot of head knowledge.

#Jesus said ""Do not worry on what to eat or wear. Pagans run after such things, but your Heavenly Father knows that you need them. Hence, seek first His kingdom and righteousness, and all these things will be given to you.""

The way Jesus was written in S7 and S8 was horrible. The writers knew there was no fixing his character, so they took the easy route and killed him off. He shouldn’t of been a character to get lost in the story. I have no idea how they messed him up that badly. #TWD

Jesus didn’t tell His disciples to learn prayer from Him. They asked to be taught. Jesus didn’t  tell His Disciples to learn Holiness or Miracles or Wisdom or anything else from Him. 

He told them to learn humility from Him!

A voice preaching
Should never be comprised of
Alluring words in man's wisdom

This way
Your faith
Is not found in man's wisdom

Instead
It should be comprised of
Christ Jesus & The Holy Spirit
Substantiated through
The Power of God !

It ought to be the first concern of every Christian to lay aside all confidence in works and increasingly to strengthen faith alone and through faith to grow in the knowledge, not of works, but of Christ Jesus, who suffered and rose for him.

So many are ""Christian"" in head-knowledge only. There’s belief, but no behavior; knowing, but no doing. Remember, even demons believe. This is why Jesus saying ""I never knew you"" will be such a shock to so many. They knew about Jesus, but didn't know Jesus. There's a difference.
