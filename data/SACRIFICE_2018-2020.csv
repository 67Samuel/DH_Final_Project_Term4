Generous giving doesn't impoverish - but enriches the heart
Jesus probes our hearts as well. Generosity demands a measure of self-sacrifice. However, it doesn't impoverish, but rather enriches the soul of the giver."

To preach the gospel, u will have to choose the truth of Christ's sacrifice and offering of forgiveness to the world, over being politically correct and appealing to everyone.  

There is no diplomacy in this matter.

- to willingly join Jesus in the fellowship of suffering 
- to willingly go low & embrace the exposing of the inner man by the Spirit
- to willingly yield to the forming of the character of Jesus

Interestingly, the Bible doesn't ever just say that God loves us. It says: ""God demonstrated his love.."" ""For God so loved the world that he gave.."" True love, redemptive love, God-styled love is active; it does something. Jesus did more than something; he sacrificed everything.

What are you thankful for on this Thanksgiving?
I am thankful for Jesus #1, for salvation by faith in His atoning sacrifice on the cross.
I am thankful that, even though I was an only child at birth, I now have brothers and sisters all over the world!  What an amazing God!

To see Muurs frying in Th fire, To see Muurs being Roasted like chestnuts Th dark meat 
 was eaten. 
Streams of their blood quenching like shingles on Xmas tree, 
Th stench was horrible; but Th victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave praise thereof to Jesus God.

No.
