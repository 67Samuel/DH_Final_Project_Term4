5 When Jesus saw their faith,He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”

6 And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, 7 “Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

These troubles come to prove that your faith is pure.  This purity of faith is worth more than gold which can be proved to be pure by fire but will ruin.  But the purity of your faith will bring you praise and glory and honour when Jesus Christ is shown to you. - 1 Peter 1:7

When people don’t think they’re loved in life:
-they rebel
-they go out into the world
-they develop a “no care” attitude
-they don’t care about other’s well being

The Bible says that in the end the hearts of many will grow cold

Our only source of hope is in Jesus
Cling to Him.

Tzitziyot (the tassles on Jesus' hem) are reminders to keep #Torah, but obedience without faith can't save or heal.

Conversely, mere belief that God can heal isn't enough. #Faith without works is dead. If you believe, you will act.

Come as you are, as the sinner you have been this week.
Then let Jesus through the ways he has chosen, give you forgiveness, help you don’t deserve, peace and hope,
show you his Father and the life of his Spirit. 
Come with other sinners and receive Jesus.
