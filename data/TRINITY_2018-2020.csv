We are Muslims and we didn't believe in trinity of God. Jesus (PBUH) & everyone in this world are Allah's creature. So, it's wrong to call us assistant Allah. And if you decide to do so, I am announcing this to you that you will rot in hellfire. Put it at the back of your brain.

If I could, I'd abolish grades in seminary. Getting a 2.78 or 4.0 tells me nothing. Do you love the Trinity more? Do you handle Scripture more carefully? Are you humbled by church history? Is your character more like Jesus? Do you serve friend & enemy alike? That's what matters.

1 Corinthians 15:27-28 Jesus subjected to his Father in violation of the Trinity teaching. Thus, Jesus was visable and God the Father has never been. John 1:18. The so called God-man is a foolish assumption. And Jesus prayed for his Father's will to happen, not his own.

A Jehovah's Witness tried to tell me Jesus isn't God because the Bible says God raised Jesus from the dead (Acts 13:30). It does say that--the whole Trinity raised Jesus from the dead: the Father (Rom 6:4), the Spirit (Rom 8:11,1Pet 3:18), and Jesus himself (John 2:19-21, 10:18).

Watchtower teaches that the trinity doesn't make sense because Jesus can’t be the Father, yet that’s false. That’s not what the trinity teaches at all. The Trinity teaches that Jesus and the Father and the Holy Spirit are all “different beings” but they make up ... God.

Today's CHRISTIANITY is mainly based on falsehood/ made-up doctrines.
TRINITY was made up!
CRUCIFICATION of JESUS never happened! Everything about it was taken on hearsay!

Jesus forgave sins
That’s why they yelled, “blasphemy!”

He claimed to be God. Because He is God.

Can we wrap our rational heads around the Trinity? Not really. So we trust. By faith.

Presenting rational evidence trying to persuade that Jesus is not God..is what the Devil does.

You never hear any Christian talk the rift between Jesus/James teachings (follow the law) and Paul's teachings, (we don't have to follow the law because of Jesus. Have faith in Jesus.), yet Jesus never taught the Trinity. He taught to love one God.

468. At Constantinople (553), the Church confessed that Jesus Christ is a single person, human and divine, one of the Trinity. Everything that is his human nature is also his divine nature, his miracles but also his death.

Though not a literal offspring of Satan, this man of sin is the counterfeit of the Lord Jesus. 

2. Trinity

God is a Trinity - made up of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Satan has his own unholy trinity - himself, the beast, and the false prophet."

Christ isn’t actually Jesus himself but the 2nd of the Trinity (the son) which Jesus is a part of but we are all equally a part of as well. The Christ is the son of God & every human being is part of this sonship.

The trinity doctrine says that Jesus had to be God because only God can keep his commandments perfectly. That doesn’t condemn sin it justifies it & gives the original man Adam an excuse for his sin. God created Adam  with the ability to keep his words. He created man very good.

Why do the cults & modern religionists have a problem with the concept of the deity of Jesus Christ and the Trinity? Because they trust in intellectualism, rationalism,and scholarship that leads to unbelief; they seek truth through human wisdom and logic instead of through faith.

Heresy is often viewed as doctrine that deviates from Salvific doctrine of the true Christian faith, such as doctrine of the Trinity, and Salvation comes through Jesus alone. All heresy is an attack on Salvific doctrine, but heresy  need not pertain directly to Salvific doctrine.

The Pharisees couldn’t accept the fact that God granted a human authority to forgive sins. The trinitatian/Jesus doctrine shows that same spirit by rejecting the fact that Jesus was truly a man. It says he has too much authority so it makes him into God.
