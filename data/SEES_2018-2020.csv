Loving someone even when they’ve wronged you doesn’t always mean letting them back into your life.

It means choosing to see them as a Child of God. They are not their mistake. They are not their failure. They are not their shortcoming.

Resist your resentment. When you see rioters or racists (both of whom are destroyers) you see people who need to be STOPPED, but you, Christian, need to see more. See people in need of the Gospel. Don’t curse them. Pray for them. Cut through the noise with the name of Jesus.

Lord Jesus, who prayed that we might all be one,
we pray to you for the unity of Christians,
according to your will,
according to your means.
May your Spirit enable us
to experience the suffering caused by division,
to see our sin
and to hope beyond all hope.
Amen.

Church, its not whether we know Jesus or not at His appearing on the clouds that matters most;

It is whether the Lamb of God knows you at His coming that will make you worthy to be gathered unto Him.

There is a difference. You CAN ""know Him"" while He still doesn't know you.

Fall in love with Jesus
and fall in love with the journey
you are on with Him. 
The more time you spend with Him
the more you begin to see
all of this is a part of the process
of who you are becoming.

If only i knew that they will kill you ten years ago, I wouldn't have left you.
But as we prayed as a family, you told us to make up our minds, that we might not live to see tomorrow!
You sacrifice to let us live!
I pray that your killers find Jesus!

I just see no reason to agree with the worldly romantic notion that every person has just one 'soul mate' out there... It turns the search for a godly spouse into an audition to be the one who 'completes' you... No spouse can complete you... only Jesus can.

Oft times th day seems long
Our trials hard 2 bear
We´re tempted 2 complain
2 murmur & despair
But Christ will soon appear
2 catch His Bride away
All tears 4ever over n God’s eternal day
It will be worth it all when we see Jesus
Life’s trials will seem so small
When we see Christ

Lord Jesus, help me to really see those you bring across my path today. They are dying to be seen. And if I can, for one moment, stop trying so hard to be seen, then I might actually be able to see them and love them the way you desire me to.

It doesn’t matter what you are going through; tough times, loneliness or hurt, Jesus knows about it. He’s always with you; never absent. You may not feel it or your situation may not be saying it but don’t quit.

Taking a walk with Edame holding hands in the rain. She said, “Is it raining? I hadn’t noticed.” To which I replied, “Jesus love it’s pissing down.” Now she looks annoyed. Don’t know why. Off home shortly for a hot Ribena.

Following Jesus is the greatest decision I’ve ever made, because I have a purpose... even when it’s hard to see. He saved my life, but that’s not all he did. He gave me a chance to live a life of REAL hope and love. And now I can spread that hope.

Today-instead of Rich Young Rulers we see Bitter young Christians. Good kids, who obeserved all the commandments from their youth, but suffered damage in the church, and are now unwilling to exchange earthly revenge for heavenly treasures. 

Jesus loves you-follow Him.
