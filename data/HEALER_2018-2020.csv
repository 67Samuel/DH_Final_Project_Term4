In today’s Gospel, Jesus demonstrates his compassion as He heals a leper. “Lord, if you wish, you can make me clean.” Jesus stretched out His hand, touched him, and said, “I will do it. Be made clean” (cf. Mt 8:1-4). He will heal us if we ask Him.

REMINDER: If you're a pastor, it's ok to admit you need a break because your mental health is suffering.

Jesus won't shame you
and he'll keep looking after his church
even when you can't cope.

Concerned about your church's reaction?
I've been there. I'd love to chat with you

There's need for the teaching of the gospel of Christ. 

His teaching is instructive; His teaching is illuminating; His teaching is directive; His teaching is life giving.

Jesus is the Teacher. And like never before, the church (universally speaking) needs His teaching. Selah

People often tell me, “I feel like GOD is punishing me.”

They don’t understand GOD’s Gift of righteousness & His Grace as described in Romans 5.

GOD will ultimately punish those who reject JESUS. But in this time, He extends His hand to save, help, & heal—not punish.
