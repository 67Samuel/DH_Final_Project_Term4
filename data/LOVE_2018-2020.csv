care about those who couldn’t care less about you.
love those who would never love you in return.
forgive those who don’t deserve it.

Our Love fulfills all that the Law required of us

Under the Law, GOD demanded righteousness 

Under Grace, GOD supplies righteousness to us thru Jesus

Sin is sin. You can be straight, gay, white, black, rich or poor... we need to love everyone as Jesus loved. He loved the downtrodden. He protected the poor. He wanted equality as everyone was created in His image.

HE DIDNT WANT RACISTS TO BE CELEBRATED. RACIST PEOPLE ARE EVIL.

He didn't tell them they were fine as they were.

He sat with them, and told them they had to change, because he actually cared for them.

You died for my sin though I sinned against you.
You loved me when I didn’t love you.
You accepted me though many times I rejected you.
You pursued me even though I ran from you.
You saved me when I deserved Hell.

I affirm that the creeds are the symbol of the faith and are necessary for discipleship.

But Jesus said all people will know we are disciples NOT by our right doctrine, but by the way we love. 

As important as theology and doctrine are, if we have not love, we are nothing.

When people don’t think they’re loved in life:

-they develop a “no care” attitude
-they don’t care about other’s well being

Christians need to learn what Jesus meant when He said “forgive them Father, for they know not what they do”.

If you’re going to get offended every time someone bad mouths God then you’ll become an individual that reacts in offence instead responding in love.

LOVE tells people the truth about sin and how it separates man from God. 
It’s not popular, 
the world might turn against you, 
they killed the prophets, 
Jesus gave His life for it.

If the world hates you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.

Jesus reportedly said the truth would set us free--so why do large denominations within the Christian church still reject scientific truth? Do they really care about truth or what Jesus said? Or do they just like to cry ""Lord! Lord!"" and wave a Bible around to show their piety?

I must remember love & discerning wisdom go together.

Jesus praised the church at Ephesus for its doctrinal vigilance, but rebuked its loss of love (Rev 2:1-7). By contrast, to the church at Thyatira, Jesus commended its love and critiqued its compromise with falsehood (2:18-29)

Godly love has a relationship to the deeply, personal experience of being forgiven. To be forgiven much is to love much. Jesus said: “But he who has been forgiven little loves little.” No doubt this is one of the reasons love has been called “the hallmark of the church.”"

Yes Jesus loves me.
The Bible tells me so..

The Bible is filled with love letters from God.

""For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.""
John 3:16

There is no one you will engage with the Gospel:
- In whom God is not already at work in their heart. 
- and who God doesn’t already love.
- and who wouldn’t be better off with Jesus as their personal Lord & Savior. 
(I’ll never forget this charge from Dr. Roy Fish) #engage

Let us be true to ourselves: 
Let us know our worth;
Let us love ourselves and others;
And let us grow to be better Ateneans.
In this we ask in Jesus' name, amen.

By the way, super worthwhile listen on

 and 
@TheMikeSalk
 the other day with Kevin Burkhardt where he was told Schottenheimer “fell in love with Russell” too much in weeks 1-2, and they had a “come to Jesus” meeting to get back to their identity around the run.

Bleeding and still loving
Bleeding but still giving
Bleeding and still believing 
Bleeding but still smiling
Bleeding and still parenting 
Bleeding but still living

To the one reading, recieve healing in every area you are bleeding in Jesus name. Amen!

Whoever says they follow Jesus should: 
Love, the way He loves! 
Give, the way He gives! 
Serve, the way He serves! 
Forgive, the way He forgives!

Why should i be sad? With the presence of Jesus festival, I was reminded of how much He loves us despite the fact that we've all committed mistakes that are somehow unforgivable in our own perspectives, He'll still leave the 99 for you. Never take that kind of love for granted
