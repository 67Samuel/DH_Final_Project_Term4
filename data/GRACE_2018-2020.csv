Jesus died for thieves.
Jesus died for liars.
Jesus died for porn addicts.
Jesus died for murderers.
Jesus died for sinners.

Focus on receiving His grace, not your bad resume. The love of Jesus is greater than the thing you think disqualifies you. God is making all things new.

This morning's meditation:

God loves everyone, ""good enough"" or not, and that is a grace.

And.

Jesus specifically sought out those who were not ""good enough"" - who weren't qualified, asked questions, made others uncomfortable.

And that, today, is a grace for me.

Jesus Christ did not remove the Law. Gods Commandments are still in effect. Wait. Dont get ahead of me. Believers are dead to the Law & under grace. Nonbelievers are under the Law. Which is why, unless they repent & believe on Christ, they are condemned under the Law.

People often tell me, “I feel like GOD is punishing me.”

They don’t understand GOD’s Gift of righteousness & His Grace as described in Romans 5.

GOD will ultimately punish those who reject JESUS. But in this time, He extends His hand to save, help, & heal—not punish.

Be reminded today that the desire of Jesus is to rescue those who are far from God, those who have wandered off. You are never too far from His saving grace and love.

“For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.” John 3.17
